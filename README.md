# Abstract
CrackTrack is a deep learning-based road damage classification system designed to automate the identification of common surface defects such as Alligator Cracks, Lateral Cracks, Longitudinal Cracks, and Potholes. Leveraging a pre-trained ResNet18 model, the project demonstrates an end-to-end image classification pipeline—spanning preprocessing, prediction, and result visualization—within a Google Colab environment. While the current implementation uses simulated outputs for demonstration, the architecture is ready for integration with real-world datasets. CrackTrack aims to provide a scalable, cost-effective solution for smart infrastructure maintenance, with future plans for model training, geotagging support, and web/mobile deployment.
